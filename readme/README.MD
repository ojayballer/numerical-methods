# Computational Methods (Numerical Methods)

This repository contains well-documented implementations of some  various **Numerical Methods** in Python — a core part of computational mathematics and scientific computing. Each method focuses on solving real-world mathematical problems such as solving equations, interpolation, integration, differential equations, and more.

## What’s Inside

The repo is organized into multiple folders — each representing a different numerical method or concept. These include:

- **LU Decomposition**
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**
- **Cubic Spline Interpolation**
- **Thomas Algorithm**
- **Runge-Kutta Methods**
- **Newton-Raphson**
- **Numerical Integration**
-

Each folder contains:
- The core Python implementation of the method
- A dedicated `README.md` file that explains:
  - What the method does
  - When and why to use it
  - Sample inputs/outputs
  - Execution instructions
- Optionally, visualizations of the computed results

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning tool for:
- Students taking Computational or Numerical Methods courses
- Anyone interested in applying numerical solutions to mathematical and engineering problems
- Developers who want to understand and visualize these techniques from scratch
